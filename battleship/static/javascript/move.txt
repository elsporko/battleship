Implementing move class.

Move class represents the steps taken during a player's turn.

During their move a player can make as many moves as their are opponents. A move can be:
	* Attack another player (similar to traditional battleship, but the attack can be on any active player).
	* Move any of their own ship in the direction that the ship is currently facing (E <-> W or N <=-> S). Restrictions on a move are;
		* Final move destination cannot have the ship overlap an existing ship
		* Ships that have been hit cannot be moved
		* If there is a damaged ship in the path of the a ship being moved that represents the boundary for how far the ship can be moved.
		* If any part of the ship ends up where an opponent has dropped a mine that ship is hit on that space
 	* Pivot any own ship so that the ship's direction is changed. (E <-> W <=>  N <-> S).
		* Pivots happen on the given point selected by the player
		* Final move destination cannot have the ship overlap an existing ship
		* Ships that have been hit cannot be moved
		* If there is a damaged ship in the path of the a ship being moved that represents the boundary for how far the ship can be moved.
		* If any part of the ship ends up where an opponent has dropped a mine that ship is hit on that space
	* Drop a mine onto any opponent's grid. There will be a limited number of mines to drop

Moves are executed all at once in the order assigned by the player. Moves can be reordered before being executed. If one move conflicts with or affects
another then affected rules will not be executed. For example, a player moves a destroyer, pivots, attacks another player and then drops a mine on a different player. Upon
resolving moves the destroyer is hit during the first step so the pivot will not happen. The attack and mine drop parts of the move will occur.

Player moves are displayed as they are made and can be reordered until they are executed. Moves can also be deleted from the list. Deleting attack and mine
drops are as simple as removing them from the move queue and deleting the corresponding div from the move list.
